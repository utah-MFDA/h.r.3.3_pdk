(1) use of .stl directly as the geometry for new components.
    - rational
        Most engineers will what to use thier software for generating a 3D design (such as SolidWorks, Creo, Autodesk Inventor)
        that means we will not be able to import them into this library. 
    - implementation suggestion
        Since almost all 3D modeling software will export STLs, and OpenSCAD allows for importing STLs we could have a 
        simple way to import the geometry. However, this will NOT be compatible with the current implementation of
        merging a scad file used in the modelgen software. Unless we can have that software point to this directory we
        shouldn't have any issues.
